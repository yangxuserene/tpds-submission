Section 1 - Introduction : This section is revised to clearly state the motivations and the problem, as well as the major contributions of this submission.

Section 2 - Background: Add a new paragraph to describe the Cori, a dragonfly connected HPC system in production at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. We also discuss the difference between the dragonfly topology used in this work and the Cori system. 

section 3.2 . Detailed description about applications communication pattern is included. In particular, three new figures are added to demonstrate the communication matrix of each application. 
section 3.3 . This section is revised to explicitly explain the choice of parameters for the dragonfly network used in our study. 

section 7. In addition to the previously discussed placement policies, A new section is included to discuss two new placement policies. We use workload 1 to evaluate both placement policies whether they are effective in preventing "bully" effect. Experimental results show an interesting relation between the randomness of the allocation and application performance. 

section 8. This section is revised to include more recent work about job placement on HPC systems. 

section 9. This section is revised to discuss two possible directions for extending our work in the future.
